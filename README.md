# 🚀 DevArena: The Ultimate Backend Playground 🚀

## 🏆 Hackathon Pitch
In today's fast-paced tech world, backend engineers lack a space to practice system design and coding in a fun, competitive, and visual way. **DevArena** is our answer. It's an AI-powered, interactive platform where developers can duel, design, and dominate. Think of it as a gym, a dojo, and a creative canvas for backend developers, all rolled into one.

## 🤯 The Problem
- **Coding is not just about algorithms**: It's about system design, architecture, and understanding trade-offs.
- **Learning can be isolating**: Reading docs and watching videos is passive. Developers need to *do*.
- **Interview prep is a grind**: LeetCode is great, but it doesn't prepare you for system design interviews or real-world architectural thinking.

## ✨ Our Solution: DevArena
DevArena transforms backend practice from a chore into an engaging experience. We combine competitive coding with a drag-and-drop system design playground and a suite of AI-powered tools to create a holistic learning environment.
